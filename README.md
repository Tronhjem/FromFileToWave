# FromFileToWave

Still very much a work in progress and still it's early stages.

The plan is to create a wave table synth that reads in any file as either 8 16 24 or 32 bit integers, reads a given number of tables of a given size and a given number of tables. This will allow a user to built morpth through a file and explore new timbres. 
If the user desieres these could of course be carefully currated wave tables too as it's just data. 
The idea is to later have more files, in order to have a 2D map of morphing wave tables.

Disclaimer: AI may have been used in this project but mostly for tedious tasks and code reviews. It's by no means a vibe coded project.
